```
* Install Python Version 3 or above.
```
```
* Add Audio Files to the Voice_Samples_Training Folder (.wav format) and with respect to the audio files 
  	add the directory to the file Voice_Samples_Training_Path.txt
```
```
* Train your audio samples to create a gmm model by running the modeltraining.py in IDLE or any editor.
```
```
* After the model is trained they will be stored in the folder Trained_Speech_Models with respect to every speaker 
  	in the form of .gmm file.
```
```
* Add all the testing audio samples at the testing_Audio Folder and its path in Testing_audio_Path.txt file.
```
```
* Now you can test your model by running main.py file.
